Overall there are 44,064 simulations, each including 179 features of historical information capturing the dynamics of the simulated 39 bus power grid through time. The time-series data of each simulation is stored in a separate CSV file and include features such as active and reactive power of lines, active and reactive power of generators, active power of wind generators, voltages and frequencies of bus elements, excitation currents, rotor angle, speed, and tap positions of transformers. Each feature is time-stamped allowing the windowing of data sequences that are needed for training the model. Each simulation was carried out under different scenarios and operating conditions including different fault locations. To simulate a real-world scenario that could potentially lead to cascading failures, a disturbance was injected into the system at 1.0 seconds and removed at 1.07 seconds.

A separate CSV file contains the results of the simulations. Each row of this file includes a simulation ID number that points to the time-series data of the corresponding simulation. It also includes a summary of the location of the fault, the sequence of cascading events in case that happened, the active power of 3 wind generators, the loading of the system, and the label which takes values 0, 1, 2 or 3. The values 2 and 3 indicate an error during the simulation and therefore are not used in training. These values combined appeared 999 times. The results show that in 35,934 simulations there was no failure in the system, and label 0 is used to describe this outcome. In the other hand, there were 7,131 simulations that led to at least one component failure and these are labelled as 1.
