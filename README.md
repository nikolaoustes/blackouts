Cascading failures constitute significant threads to the dynamic behaviour of a power system resulting in significant instabilities that could lead to a blackout. The early and accurate prediction of such failures is a challenging task, but can help in preventing widespread disruptions that can have massive and adverse effects on the society. This project utilises a Transformer encoder based Machine Learning model, capable of capturing temporal dependencies within complex power system time series data, for predicting cascading failures by performing binary classification. The developed model provides an additional valuable tool that provides explanations behind the decision making process of the model. The very high performances achieved, 98.1% accuracy, show that the task of predicting cascading failures can be accurately achieved using Machine Learning, and that the Transformer model is a powerful model capable of performing complex tasks.
